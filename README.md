# CRUD_APP (jsonModel)

This was my first time trying React and Flask. This part of the project helped me understand how to communicate between python and JS. I learned how to manipulate JSON data. How to extract values from it. How to run the project locally and test features.

This was a good introduction to the basics. I have worked on personal porftfolio website recently which is hosted in Github Pages, so I had some experience with JS and CSS, which helped a bit especially in the CSS sections. 

I have worked on python and similar languages (GDscript) but I dont think I have ever made a full fledged python app. A lot of things were new: making requirements.txt, console commands to install/build/run stuff etc.

This was my first time using a cloud hosting service. I havent worked with an app that uses a backend.
